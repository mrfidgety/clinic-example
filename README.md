# README

This repo is a demo HotDoc Rails backend, for the purposes of pair programming.

It has a scaffolded Clinic model, and a Patient model generated by Devise.

It also has a simple API namespace that renders JSON.

## Pairing Challenge Requirements

## Add a Model

Add an Appointment model
We want Patients to be able to book an Appointment at a clinic, and it should have a start time and end time.

## Add an API endpoint

Add JSON API endpoints for listing and showing the details of an appointment, for use from the Patient's mobile app.

## Include Clinic details

The name and ID of the clinic should be returned in the API response

## Extras

- Change sorting to by start time ascending
- Allow filtering on partial clinic name
- Add pagination
